# Phaser Vite + TypeScript Template

cleaned up and minimal

```sh
npm install

npm run dev
npm run build
```

## Template Project Structure

We have provided a default project structure to get you started. This is as follows:

| Path                         | Description                                                |
|------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| `index.html`                 | A basic HTML page to contain the game.                     |
| `public/assets`              | Game sprites, audio, etc. Served directly at runtime.      |
| `public/style.css`           | Global layout styles.                                      |
| `src/main.js`                | Application bootstrap.                                     |
| `src/game`                   | Folder containing the game code.                           |
| `src/game/main.js`           | Game entry point: configures and starts the game.          |
| `src/game/scenes`            | Folder with all Phaser game scenes.                        |


## Handling Assets

Vite supports loading assets via JavaScript module `import` statements.

This template provides support for both embedding assets and also loading them from a static folder. To embed an asset, you can import it at the top of the JavaScript file you are using it in:

```js
import logoImg from './assets/logo.png'
```

To load static files such as audio files, videos, etc place them into the `public/assets` folder. Then you can use this path in the Loader calls within Phaser:

```js
preload ()
{
    //  This is an example of an imported bundled image.
    //  Remember to import it at the top of this file
    this.load.image('logo', logoImg);

    //  This is an example of loading a static image
    //  from the public/assets folder:
    this.load.image('background', 'assets/bg.png');
}
```

When you issue the `npm run build` command, all static assets are automatically copied to the `dist/assets` folder.
